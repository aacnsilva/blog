With the release of <strong>Business Central 25</strong>, there&rsquo;s an enhanced approach to text search that significantly impacts how you retrieve precise results. Let&rsquo;s explore the power of full-text search within Business Central and what sets it apart.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>Full-text search in Business Central is designed for intelligent and accurate retrieval of information within text fields. It goes beyond simple string matching by understanding words and their boundaries, offering a more refined search experience than previous versions.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-syntax">The Search Syntax</h3>
<p>In Business Central, full-text search often utilizes specific syntax to trigger its optimized behavior. When a search is performed on fields specifically designed for full-text capabilities, the system applies these advanced filtering rules. If a field isn&rsquo;t optimized, the system will fall back to legacy filtering to ensure a result is still provided.</p>
<p>Here’s a comparison of how different search inputs might be interpreted:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th style="text-align: left">Full-text search input</th>
          <th style="text-align: left">Equivalent traditional search logic</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><code>&amp;&amp;com</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">@*COM*</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td style="text-align: left"><code>&amp;&amp;com&amp;&amp;&amp;cust</code></td>
          <td style="text-align: left">@*COM*&amp;*CUST*</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="precision-in-results-a-key-difference">Precision in Results: A Key Difference</h3>
<p>A primary advantage of full-text search in Business Central is its ability to deliver more focused and relevant results. Unlike searches that might capture any occurrence of a string, full-text search prioritizes matching whole words or the beginnings of words.</p>
<p>Consider these records: <code>ECOMMERCE CUSTOMER</code>, <code>COMPANY CUSTOMER</code>, <code>ADATUM COMPANY</code></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how different search types might perform:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Searching for &ldquo;com&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-text search:</strong> Retrieves <code>COMPANY CUSTOMER</code>, <code>ADATUM COMPANY</code>
<ul>
<li>(It matches the word &ldquo;COMPANY&rdquo; in both records, as &ldquo;COMPANY&rdquo; starts with &ldquo;com&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Traditional substring search:</strong> Retrieves <code>ECOMMERCE CUSTOMER</code>, <code>COMPANY CUSTOMER</code>, <code>ADATUM COMPANY</code>
<ul>
<li>(It finds &ldquo;COMMERCE&rdquo; within <code>ECOMMERCE CUSTOMER</code>, and &ldquo;COMPANY&rdquo; in the other two, capturing any occurrence of &ldquo;com&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Searching for &ldquo;com&rdquo; AND &ldquo;cust&rdquo;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-text search:</strong> Retrieves <code>COMPANY CUSTOMER</code>
<ul>
<li>(It finds records containing both a word starting with &ldquo;com&rdquo; AND a word starting with &ldquo;cust&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Traditional substring search:</strong> Retrieves <code>ECOMMERCE CUSTOMER</code>, <code>COMPANY CUSTOMER</code>
<ul>
<li>(It finds records containing &ldquo;com&rdquo; anywhere AND &ldquo;cust&rdquo; anywhere)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This demonstrates that full-text search provides a more refined result set by intelligently focusing on word beginnings and meaningful word units.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-optimized-text-search-in-business-central">Understanding Optimized Text Search in Business Central</h2>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s documentation, which applies to this functionality in Business Central, further clarifies its capabilities compared to traditional wildcard searches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case Insensitivity:</strong> Optimized text search is inherently case-insensitive, meaning &ldquo;apple&rdquo; will match &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; or &ldquo;APPLE&rdquo; without special handling. Traditional wildcard searches often require explicit settings or operators to achieve case insensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Accent Insensitivity:</strong> Similarly, optimized text search is accent-insensitive, so &ldquo;résumé&rdquo; will match &ldquo;resume.&rdquo; Wildcard searches typically treat accented and unaccented characters as distinct unless specific collation settings are applied.</li>
<li><strong>Word-Based Matching:</strong> This is a crucial distinction:
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized text search</strong> looks for <strong>words or prefixes of words</strong> within fields. For example, searching for &ldquo;app&rdquo; would find &ldquo;application&rdquo; or &ldquo;apple&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional wildcard search</strong> can find <strong>arbitrary substrings</strong> within words. A wildcard search for <code>*app*</code> would find &ldquo;unhappy&rdquo; because &ldquo;app&rdquo; is a substring, even if it&rsquo;s not the start of a word.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper dive into these technical aspects, especially in the context of Business Central development, you can consult resources like the Microsoft documentation on table field text search: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-field-text-search">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-table-field-text-search</a></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the release of Business Central, full-text search offers a sophisticated and precise method for data retrieval. By understanding its word-based approach, inherent case and accent insensitivity, and how it differs from traditional substring matching, you can leverage this powerful feature to find exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for with greater efficiency and accuracy within your Business Central environment.</p>
